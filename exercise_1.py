#refering to member variables
#Referring to member variables
#Calling class member variables works the same whether those values are created within the class
# (like our car's condition) or values are passed into the new object at initialization. We use dot notation to access the member variables of classes since those variables belong to the object.

#For instance, if we had created a member variable named new_variable,
# a new instance of the class named new_object could access this variable by saying:

new_object.new_variable


#Now that you've created my_car print its member variables:

#First print the model of my_car. Click "Stuck? Get a hint!" for an example.
#Then print out the color of my_car.

#The perimeter() class method is identical to defining any other function, except that it is written inside of the Square class definition.

#Just like when we defined __init__(), you need to provide self as the first argument of any class method.
